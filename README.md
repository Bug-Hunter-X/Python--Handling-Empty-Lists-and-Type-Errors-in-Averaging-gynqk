This repository contains a Python example that highlights a common coding error involving handling empty lists and type errors during calculations. The `bug.py` file shows the buggy code, while `bugSolution.py` provides a robust solution. The example focuses on calculating the average of a list of numbers, demonstrating error handling for both empty lists and lists containing non-numeric data.  This scenario commonly arises in data processing and is crucial to handling gracefully.
